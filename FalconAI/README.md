## Introduction

The Falcon AI project is dedicated to exploring and advancing generative AI techniques. It provides a curated collection of projects that cover various aspects of generative AI, including image generation, text generation, music generation, and more. Each project within the Falcon AI repository focuses on a specific generative AI topic, providing code examples, pre-trained models, and detailed instructions to help you understand and experiment with these techniques.

## Getting_Started

To get started with Falcon AI, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Clone the Falcon AI repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GenAI.git
    ```
2.  **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
    See the requirements.txt file for a list of required packages.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Dataset**: Prepare the dataset required for the specific project you want to explore. Instructions on obtaining or generating the dataset can usually be found within each project's directory.

4.  **Model Training**: Train the generative AI model using Qlora techniques. Refer to the project's README.md file for detailed instructions on how to train the model.

5.  **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance and generate outputs. The project's README.md file will provide guidance on how to perform evaluations and generate samples.

## Usage
Each project within the Falcon AI repository has its own directory, containing the necessary code, models, and instructions specific to that project. To use a particular project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README.md file.

You can also explore the various projects available in the repository by browsing through the project directories and selecting the one that interests you the most. Feel free to experiment, modify, and enhance the existing projects to suit your needs.
